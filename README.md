<p style="font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:120%;color:#444160;" >This repository contain our solution(2nd place) to the Machine Learning Contest organized by BIT Mesra in which we have to create predictive models to predict the stage of liver Cirrhosis using 18 clinical features as Cirrhosis damages the liver from a variety of causes leading to
scarring and liver failure.</p>
<h3>Motivation Behind The Problem Statement</h3>
<p style="font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:120%;color:#444160;" >Hepatitis and chronic alcohol abuse are frequent causes of the
disease. Liver damage caused by cirrhosis can't be undone, but
further damage can be limited. Treatments focus on the
underlying cause. In advanced cases, a liver transplant may be
required. Predicting the stage of cirrhosis and beginning the
treatment before it's too late can prevent the fatal
consequences of the disease.</p>
